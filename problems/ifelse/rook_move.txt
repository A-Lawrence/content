Name:
Rook move

Statement:
Chess rook moves horizontally or vertically. Given two different cells of the chessboard, determine whether a rook can go from the first cell to the second in one move.

<p>
The program receives the input of four numbers from 1 to 8, each specifying the column and row number, first two - for the first cell, and then the last two - for the second cell.
The program should output <code>YES</code> if a rook can go from the first cell to the second in one move, or <code>NO</code> otherwise.
