Name:
Access rights

Statement:
<p>The virus attacked the filesystem of the supercomputer and broke
the control of access rights to the files. For each file
there is a known set of operations which may be applied to it:</p>

<ul>
<li>write <code>W</code>,
<li>read <code>R</code>,
<li>execute <code>X</code>.
</ul>

<p>
The first line contains the number <code>N</code> — the number of files contained in the filesystem.
The following <code>N</code> lines contain the file names and allowed operations with them, separated by spaces.

The next line contains an integer <code>M</code> — the number of operations to the files.
In the last <code>M</code> lines specify the operations that are requested for files. 
One file can be requested many times.
</p>

<p>You need to recover the control over the access rights to the files.
For each request your program should return <code>OK</code>
if the requested operation is valid or
<code>Access denied</code> if the operation is invalid.</p>
