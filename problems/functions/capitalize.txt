Name:
Uppercase

Statement:
Write a function capitalize(), which takes the word of lowercase Latin letters and returns it, changing the first letter to uppercase.

<p>Eg., print(capitalize('word')) should print the word <code>Word</code>.

<p>The input is a string consisting of words separated by a single space. The words consist of lowercase Latin letters. Print the original string with every word being capitalized. Call your function <code>capitalize()</code> for that.

<p>In Python there is a function <code>ord()</code>, which returns its character code in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">the ASCII chart</a>, and the function <code>chr()</code>, which returns the character code of the character itself. For example, <code>ord('a') == 97</code>, <code>chr(97) == 'a'</code>.
