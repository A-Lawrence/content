Name:
Cubes

Statement:
<p>Alice and Bob like to play with colored cubes. Each kid has its own
set of cubes and in each set all the cubes have distinct colors. The kids want to know
how many colors exist such that the cubes of the color are present in both
sets. The kids enumerated all the colors with random numbers from 0 to 10<sup>8</sup>. At this point their enthusiasm dried up, therefore you are invited to help them in the remaining part.</p>

<p>The first line of the input contains integers N and M &mdash; the number of cubes that Alice and Bob
respectively have.
The following N lines contain the numbers of colors of cubes in Alice's set. The last M rows
contain the numbers of colors of cubes in Bob's set.</p>

<p>Find three sets: the numbers of colors of cubes that are in both sets;
the numbers of colors of cubes that only Alice has and the numbers of colors of cubes
that only Bob has.
For each set, firstly print the number of elements in it, and then the elements themselves,
sorted in ascending order.</p>
