{% section "For loop" %}
<p>In the previous lessons we dealt with sequential programs and conditions.
Often the program needs to repeat some block several times. That's where the loops come in handy.
There are <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loop operators in Python, in this lesson we cover <code>for</code>.

<p><code>for</code> loop iterates over any sequence.
Let's see the simplest example of using for:
{% program %}
i = 1
for color in 'red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'cyan', 'blue', 'violet':
    print('#', i, 'color of rainbow is', color)
    i = i + 1
{% endprogram %}

<p>In this example the variable <code>color</code> iterates over the values <code>'red'</code>,
<code>'orange'</code> etc, and for each value the underlying loop block is executed. Loop block contains two
operators: call of the function <code>print()</code> that prints new data and assignment operator
that increases the value of the variable <code>i</code> by one.
 
<p>Loop variable can iterate over the objects of different types.
In the next example the variable <code>i</code> is pointing to <code>int</code> object for the
first three iterations and to <code>str</code> object for the last three iterations:
{% program %}
for i in 1, 2, 3, 'one', 'two', 'three':
    print(i)
{% endprogram %}

In all these examples the sequence like <code>'red', 'orange', 'yellow'</code> is actually
a compound Python object itself. It has a type <code>tuple</code> which we'll dig into more in the next lessons.

{% section "For loop with range" %}

<p>In the previous lessons we dealt with sequential programs and conditions.
Often the program needs to repeat some block several times. That's where the loops come in handy.
There are <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loop operators in Python, in this lesson we cover <code>for</code>.

<p><code>for</code> loop iterates over any sequence. For instance, any string in Python is a sequence of
its characters, so we can iterate over them using <code>for</code>:
{% program %}
for character in 'hello':
    print(character)
{% endprogram %}

<p>Another use case for a for-loop is to iterate some integer variable in increasing or decreasing order.
Such a sequence of integer can be created using the function <code>range(min_value, max_value)</code>:
{% program %}
for i in range(5, 8):
    print(i, i ** 2)
print('end of loop')
# 5 25
# 6 36
# 7 49
# end of loop
{% endprogram %}

<p>Function <code>range(min_value, max_value)</code> generates a sequence with numbers
<code>min_value</code>, <code>min_value + 1</code>, ..., <code>max_value - 1</code>. The last number is not
included.

<p>There's a reduced form of range() - <code>range(max_value)</code>, in which case min_value is implicitly
set to zero:
{% program %}
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
# 0
# 1
# 2
{% endprogram %}

<p>This way we can repeat some action several times:
{% program %}
for i in range(2 ** 2):
    print('Hello, world!')
{% endprogram %}

<p>Same as with if-else, indentation is what specifies which instructions are controlled by <code>for</code> and which aren't.

<p>Range() can define an empty sequence, like <code>range(-5)</code> or <code>range(7, 3)</code>. In this
case the for-block won't be executed:
{% program %}
for i in range(-5):
    print('Hello, world!')
{% endprogram %}


<p>Let's have more complex example and sum the integers from 1 to n inclusively.

{% program %}
result = 0
n = 5
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    result += i
    # this ^^ is the shorthand for
    # result = result + i
print(result)
{% endprogram %}
 
<p>Pay attention that maximum value in range() is <code>n + 1</code> to make <code>i</code>
equal to n on the last step.
 
<p>To iterate over a decreasing sequence, we can use an extended form of range() with three
arguments - <code>range(start_value, end_value, step)</code>. When omitted, the step is implicitly
equal to 1. However, can be any non-zero value. The loop always includes start_value and excludes end_value
during iteration:
{% program %}
for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(i)
# 10
# 8
# 6
# 4
# 2
{% endprogram %}
 
{% endsection %}



{% section "setting the function print()" %}
By default, the function <code>print()</code> prints all its arguments separating them by a space and the puts
a newline symbol after it. This behavior can be changed using keyword arguments <code>sep</code> (separator) and <code>end</code>.

{% program %}
print(1, 2, 3)
print(4, 5, 6)
print(1, 2, 3, sep=', ', end='. ')
print(4, 5, 6, sep=', ', end='. ')
print()
print(1, 2, 3, sep='', end=' -- ')
print(4, 5, 6, sep=' * ', end='.')
{% endprogram %}
