{% section "Input from a file" %}

<p>Suppose you want to read the file <code>input.txt</code>. Assume the file <code>input.txt</code> is in the same folder as our program.

The program would be as follows:

{% noprogram %}
fin = open('input.txt', 'r')
a = fin.readlines()
{% endnoprogram %}

<p>After that, the list <code>a</code> will contain the list of strings of the file. For example, if <code>input.txt</code> was
{% noprogram %}
abcd
efgh
{% endnoprogram %}
then the command <code>print(a)</code> will print out <code>['abcd\n', 'efgh\n']</code>.
The last symbol of each line &mdash; <code>'\n'</code> &mdash; is the special character, meaning "the end of line". Note: this is one character, not two characters.

<p>You can delete that useless characters with the help of the method <code>strip()</code>. In this case, you can read your file as follows:
{% noprogram %}
fin = open('input.txt', 'r')
a = [line.strip() for line in fin.readlines()]
{% endnoprogram %}
{% endsection %}


{% section "Output to a file" %}
<p>To write something to a file you should open it and assign the file object to a variable.

{% noprogram %}
fout = open('output.txt', 'w')  # 'w' is for 'write' (writeable mode)
{% endnoprogram %}

After that, you can print the file using the common command <code>print(fout)</code>:

{% noprogram %}
print(fout)
{% endnoprogram %}

Or, to make the output fancier, you can add your first line to it:

{% noprogram %}
print("Hello, world!", file=fout)
{% endnoprogram %}

After you finished working with your file, you have to close it. Otherwise, your file may not even appear on your hard disk.

{% noprogram %}
fout.close()
{% endnoprogram %}
{% endsection %}


{% section "Input-output when the number of strings is unknown" %}

<p>Suppose you need to read a file, the number of strings in which is unknown. Run the following code:

{% noprogram %}
from sys import stdin
a = stdin.readlines()
{% endnoprogram %}

<p>After that, list <code>a</code> will be the list of strings of your input file. E.g., if the input file was
{% noprogram %}
abcd
efgh
{% endnoprogram %}
then the command <code>print(a)</code> will produce <code>['abcd\n', 'efgh\n']</code>.

<p>To test your code on Windows, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Open the command line (Start &rightarrow; Execute &rightarrow; <code>cmd</code>)
<li>Using commands <code>cd</code> and <code>cd..</code> move into your program's folder. 
<li>Enter the name of your program in the command line, then press Enter. (Your program will start running)
<li>Enter the input data for your program to the command line.
<li>Mark the end of your input file by pressing Ctrl+Z. Then press Enter.
<li>Enjoy the output of your program.
</ol>
