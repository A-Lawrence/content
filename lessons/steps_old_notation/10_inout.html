{% Step 1 of X %}
<h2>It's all about the data</h2>

Every program deals with data. It can take some data for input, and it can output something.



{% program %}
{% inputdata %}
2
3
{% endinputdata %}
{% outputdata %}
"Whoopies"
{% endoutputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

So we should know how to input data into it and how to output.

{% Step 2 of X %}
<h2>Print() the paper</h2>

There's the function <code>print()</code> to output data from a Python program.

{% instructions %}
Click "Run" to see what happens in output!
{% endinstructions %}


{% program %}
print(5 + 10)
{% endprogram %}

{% allfine %}
Right, it prints 15! As easy as that!
{% endallfine %}



{% Step 3 of X %}
<h2>Your own. Personal. Calculator.</h2>

Of course you can perform any other mathematical operations! 

{% instructions %}
1. Type in the program window: <code>print(7 - 3)</code> and press "Run". 
2. Then type <code>print(4 * 5)</code> and press "Run".
3. Then type <code>print(5 / 3)</code> and press "Run".
{% endinstructions %}

{% allfine %}
Now you can use Snakify as your personal calculator.
{% endallfine %}

{% Step 4 of X %}
<h2>Reach out and touch faith.</h2>

Some more operations. In Python, you can easily calculate the value of some number in a power of another number. How to calculate 2<sup>16</sup>? Just type in: <code>print(2 ** 16)</code>

{% instructions %}
Type in: <code>print(2 ** 16)</code> and press "Run". 
{% endinstructions %}

As you see, two stars <code>**</code> are used for exponentiation.


{% Step 5 of X %}
<h2>Weird arithmetic comes in</h2>


You can perform integer division: division with remainder. If you are interested in result of division, you print <code>print(37 // 3)</code>. If you are interested in remainder, you print <code>print(37 % 3)</code>.

{% instructions %}
1. Type in the program window: <code>print(37 // 3)</code> and press "Run". 
2. Then type <code>print(37 % 3)</code> and press "Run".
{% endinstructions %}


{% allfine %}
So, <code>//</code> sign is integer division; <code>%</code> returns you the remainder of the left value divided by the right value. <code>37 = 12 * 3 + 1</code>, and this is why <code>37 // 3 = 12</code> and <code>37 % 3 = 1</code>.
{% endallfine %}



{% Step 6 of X %}
<h2>print(a, b, c)</h2>

Generally, you can print any number of values on one line. 

{% instructions %}
Just type <code>print(3*7, (17 - 2) * 8)</code> to ensure.
{% endinstructions %}

{% allfine %}
Brilliant! Let's move on.
{% endallfine %}


{% Step 7 of X %}
<h2>Come together! Right now...</h2>

Now carnival ends, and they come to the scene all together:


{% program %}
print(5 + 10)
print(7 - 3)
print(4 * 5)
print(5 / 3)
print(2 ** 16)  # two stars are used for exponentiation
print(37 / 3)  # single forward slash is a division
print(37 // 3)  # double forward slash is an integer division
print(37 % 3)  # percent sign is a modulus operator
        # it gives the remainder 
print(3 * 7, (17 - 2) * 8)
{% endprogram %}


{% Step 8 of X %}
<h2>...over me!</h2>

Note that we're allowed to have spaces between the lines:

{% program %}
print(5 + 10)
print(7 - 3)
print(4 * 5)

print(5 / 3)
print(2 ** 16)  # two stars are used for exponentiation

print(37 / 3)  # single forward slash is a division



print(37 // 3) 
print(37 % 3)  
print(3 * 7, (17 - 2) * 8)
{% endprogram %}

<b>Though, Python won't understand you if you indent your code in places where it's not expected,</b> like here: 
<code>
print("first line")
  print("second line")
</code>
would throw the error.

{% instructions %}
Indent any of the <code>print()</code> statements &mdash; add a space or two (or three, or four) prior to any print instruction &mdash; and enjoy the error message.
{% endinstructions %}

{% Step 9 of X %}
<h2>Your marvellous comments</h2>

See the English phrases after the sign <code>#</code>? They don't look like the other code. They are just text, they are remarks.

They are called comments. A <em>comment</em> is text. You write comments to clarify what happens in the code. If Python sees the sign <code>#</code>, it ignores the rest of the line and starts reading the next line, so feel free to swear after the sign <code>#</code>.

In this example we use <em>comments</em>: the explanatory text that has no effect on program execution.
This text starts with <code>#</code> and lasts till the end of the line.

{% program %}
# This program prints ton of numbers.

print(5 + 10)
print(7 - 3)
print(4 * 5)
print(5 / 3)
print(2 ** 16)  # two stars are used for exponentiation
print(37 / 3)  # single forward slash is a division
print(37 // 3) 
print(37 % 3)  
print(3 * 7, (17 - 2) * 8)
{% endprogram %}

{% Step 10 of X %}
<h2>Your marvellous comments</h2>

{% program %}
print("Scott + Mary = peace, love and death metal")
{% endprogram %}


{% instructions %}
Try to write your own comment about Scott and Mary.
{% endinstructions %}

{% allfine %}
Brilliant! Let's move on.
{% endallfine %}






{% Step 11 of X %}
<h2>Step by step</h2>

You've already seen this code, but you haven't already seen the might of our interpretator. To do it, set the tick "step by step" on and then click "Run":

{% program %}
print(5 + 10)
print(7 - 3)
print(4 * 5)
print(5 / 3)
print(2 ** 16)  # two stars are used for exponentiation
print(37 / 3)  # single forward slash is a division
print(37 // 3) 
print(37 % 3)  
print(3 * 7, (17 - 2) * 8)
{% endprogram %}

Impressed? You shall always execute programs line by line when you need to keep track of all the variables. Professional coders call it <em>debugging</em>.


{% Step 12 of X %}
<h2>The Oscar goes to you</h2>

{% instructions %}
1. Now print the remainder of the division of 41 by 7. 
2. Print 3<sup>5</sup>.
3. Print 5%(101%3) and (76//3)*4 on one line.
{% endinstructions %}

{% Step 15 of X %}
<h2>Know how to input</h2>

In our programs yet, this section was empty [the input section becomes highlighted]. Sometimes you will generally want to make your programs universal: each time you launch the program, you probably want to pass different data to it. For this, <code>input()</code> exists.



{% Step 16 of X %}
<h2>What you input is always a string</h2>

{% program %}
print(input())
{% endprogram %}


{% instructions %}
Type <code>23</code> in your input section, then run the program and see what happens.
{% endinstructions %}

{% allfine %}
The function <code>input()</code> reads your input as a string. Even if you typed 23.
{% endallfine %}


{% Step 17 of X %}
<h2>Variables</h2>


{% program %}
a = 3
print(a)
{% endprogram %}

Writing a complex program, you usually can't print the answer of your calculation right away. You use <em>variables</em> to keep intermediate results there.

Look at the code section. On the left side to assignment operator we put the name of the variable (in this case, <code>a</code>). The name could be a string of latin characters mixed with numbers, but should not start with a number. So, <code>much3q1</code> is valid name for variable, and <code>2pac</code> is not.

On the right side to assignment operator we put any expression that Python can evaluate. It can be <code>3</code> as in the code, or it can be, say <code>1 + (2 ** 8) % 5</code>.

The assignment operator is <code>=</code>.


What we've done: we assigned to the variable <code>a</code> the value of <code>3</code>. All right, now 

{% instructions %}
1. Type <code>print(a * a)</code>, run the program and see what happens.
2. Type 
<code>b = a * a
print(b)</code>
run the program and see what happens.
{% endinstructions %}



{% Step 17 of X %}
<h2>The more variables the better</h2>

Never hesitate introducing different variables! The more variables you introduce, the more readable your code would be.

{% program %}
# Compare this:
print(  exp( - (x - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma * sigma) ) / sqrt(2 * pi * sigma * sigma)  )

# to this:

numerator = exp( - (x - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma * sigma) )
denominator = sqrt(2 * pi * sigma * sigma)

N = numerator/denominator

print(N)
{% endprogram %}



{% Step 18 of X %}
<h2>Greet yourself</h2>


Here's a program that reads the user's name and greets him:
{% program %}
print('What is your name?')
name = input()  # read a single line and store it in the variable "name"
print('Hi ' + name + '!')
    {% inputdata %}
John
    {% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

{% instructions %}
Write your own name to the input section! Let it greet you!
{% endinstructions %}



{% Step 19 of X %}
<h2>The very start: summing two numbers</h2>

Let's try to write a program that has two numbers as an input and prints their sum. 

We read the two numbers and store them in the variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.

{% instructions %}
Read the code, run it and look at its output:
{% endinstructions %}
    
{% program %}
a = input()
b = input()
s = a + b
print(s)
    {% inputdata %}
5
7
    {% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}


{% Step 20 of X %}
<h2>Summing two numbers</h2>

{% program %}
a = input()
b = input()
s = a + b
print(s)
{% endprogram %}



{% instructions %}
1. On the first line of input, write a number.
2. On the second line of input, write another number.
3. Run the program.
{% endinstructions %}

{% allfine %}
After running the example we can see it prints <code>57</code>. As we were taught in school,
<code>5 + 7</code> gives <code>12</code>. What happened? 

So, the program works badly, and it is important to understand why.

The reason is, in the line <code>s = a + b</code> Python has <i>summed</i> two strings, rather than two numbers.
The sum of two strings in Python works as follows: they are just glued one after another. It's also sometimes
called <em>string concatenation</em>.
{% endallfine %}


{% Step 20 of X %}
<h2>Oops: you summed strings, not numbers</h2>


Do you see in the right side that the values bound to variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
are wrapped in quotes? 

That means these values are strings, not numbers. Strings and numbers
are represented in Python differently.

{% program %}
num = 14       # This is the number
s = 'hadoop'   # This is the string
ss = "wroom"   # This is also a string
print (s + ss)

# 'hadoop' and "wroom" have different
# quote marks, but in Python 
# it doesn't matter what quote marks to use, 
# and the output is 
# 'hadoopwroom'

{% endprogram %}


{% Step 21 of X %}
<h2>I can't multiply strings :(</h2>

All the values in Python are called <i>objects</i>. Every object has a certain type. The number 2 corresponds to an object "number 2" of type "int"
(i.e., an integer number). 

The string <code>'hello'</code> corresponds to an object "string 'hello'" of type "str".

Every fractional (floating-point) number is represented as an object of type "float". 

The type of an object specifies what kind of operations may be applied to it.
For instance, if the two variables <code>"first"</code> and <code>"second"</code> are pointing to the objects of type <code>int</code>, Python can multiply them. However, Python can't multiply strings:
    {% program %}
first = 5
second = 7
print(first * second)

# you can use single or double quotes to define a string
first = '5'
second = "7"
print(first * second)
    {% endprogram %}
</p>

{% Step 22 of X %}
<h2>Transformers: transforming string to integers </h2>

<p>
To cast the string of digits into an integer number, we can use the function <code>int()</code>. Eg., <code>int('23')</code> transforms the string '23' into the number <code>23</code>. 
</p>

{% Step 23 of X %}
<h2></h2>

Using the magic of <code>int()</code>, we can now fix our incorrent program to sum the two numbers:
    
{% program %}
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
s = a + b
print(s)
    {% inputdata %}
5
7
    {% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

{% allfine %}
You watched out the types and you were rewarded for that! Now your program when summing two numbers given in the input (entered from the keyboard). Hooray!
{% endallfine %}
