{% Step 1 of X %}
<h2>The loop called <em>for</em></h2>

In the previous lessons we dealt with sequential programs and conditions. Quite often programs need to repeat some block several times. That's where the loops come in handy. To sum first <code>n</code> numbers, you of course can write something like


{% program %}
sum = 0
sum = sum + 1
sum = sum + 2
sum = sum + 3
sum = sum + 4
sum = sum + 5
print(sum)
{% endprogram %}

But it is inconvenient. Imagine you had to sum the first 100 numbers, or iterate somehow. You surely wouldn't write the 100 lines!


{% Step 2 of X %}
<h2>The loop called <em>for</em></h2>

If you have to do fixed amount of operations &mdash; say, sum the 100 first numbers &mdash; the <code>for</code> loop saves the day.

There are <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loop operators in Python, in this lesson we cover <code>for</code>.

<p><code>for</code> loop iterates over any sequence.
Let's see the simplest example of using <code>for</code>:
{% program %}
i = 1
for color in 'red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'cyan', 'blue', 'violet':
    print('#', i, 'color of rainbow is', color)
    i = i + 1
{% endprogram %}

{% instructions %}
Press "Run" to see what will output such a program!
{% endinstructions %}



{% Step 3 of X %}
<h2>The loop called <em>for</em></h2>

{% program %}
i = 1
for color in 'red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'cyan', 'blue', 'violet':
    print('#', i, 'color of rainbow is', color)
    i = i + 1
{% endprogram %}

<p>In this example the variable <code>color</code> iterates over the values <code>'red'</code>,
<code>'orange'</code> etc, and for each value the underlying loop block is executed. Loop block contains two
operators: call of the function <code>print()</code> that prints new data and assignment operator
that increases the value of the variable <code>i</code> by one.
 
{% Step 4 of X %}
<h2>One more example of for loop</h2>

{% program %}
for i in 1, 2, 3, 'one', 'two', 'three':
    print(i)
{% endprogram %}

Loop variable can iterate over the objects of different types.
In the next example the variable <code>i</code> is pointing to <code>int</code> object for the
first three iterations and to <code>str</code> object for the last three iterations:


In all these examples the sequence like <code>'red', 'orange', 'yellow'</code> is actually
a compound Python object itself. It has a type <code>tuple</code> which we'll dig into more in the next levels.



{% Step 5 of X %}
<h2>Iterate over sequences</h2>


<p><code>for</code> loop iterates over any sequence. For instance, any string in Python is a sequence of
its characters, so we can iterate over them using <code>for</code>:
{% program %}
for character in 'hello':
    print(character)
{% endprogram %}

{% instructions %}

{% endinstructions %}

{% Step 6 of X %}
<h2>Range-1</h2>

{% program %}
for i in range(5, 8):
    print(i, i ** 2)
print('end of loop')
{% endprogram %}

<p>Another use case for a for-loop is to iterate some integer variable in increasing or decreasing order.
Such a sequence of integer can be created using the function <code>range(min_value, max_value)</code>:



{% Step 7 of X %}
<h2>Range-2</h2>

{% program %}
for i in range(4,8):
    print(i)
# This will print 4, 5, 6 and 7
{% endprogram %}


<p>Function <code>range(min_value, max_value)</code> generates a sequence with numbers
<code>min_value</code>, <code>min_value + 1</code>, ..., <code>max_value - 1</code>. The last number is <i>not</i>
included.




{% Step 8 of X %}
<h2>Range-3</h2>

{% program %}
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
# And this will print 0, 1 and 2
{% endprogram %}


<p>There's a reduced form of range() &mdash; <code>range(max_value)</code>, in which case <code>min_value</code> is implicitly
set to zero:



<p>Same as with if-else, <em>indentation</em> is what specifies which instructions are controlled by <code>for</code> and which aren't.

{% Step 9 of X %}
<h2>Don't create empty ranges</h2>

{% program %}
for i in range(-5):
    print('Hello, world!')
{% endprogram %}

<p>If you pass an empty sequence to <code>range()</code>, like <code>range(-5)</code> or <code>range(7, 3)</code>, the for-block won't be executed.

Generally, you're not interested in empty range.

{% instructions %}

{% endinstructions %}


{% Step 10 of X %}
<h2>How do you finally sum up integers?</h2>

{% program %}
result = 0
n = 5
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    result += i
    # this ^^ is the shorthand for
    # result = result + i
print(result)
{% endprogram %}

<p>Let's have more complex example and sum the integers from 1 to n inclusively.

<p>Pay attention that maximum value in range() is <code>n + 1</code> to make <code>i</code> running from 1 to <code>n</code> inclusively.

{% instructions %}

{% endinstructions %}

{% Step 11 of X %}
<h2>When *= doesn't mean a kiss</h2>

{% program %}
result = 0
debt = 1000
prod = 1
divine = 100
n = 5
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    result += i   # the same as result = result + i
    debt -= i     # the same as debt = debt - i
    prod *= i     # the same as prod = prod * i
    divine /= i     # the same as divine = divine / i
print(result)
print(debt)
print(prod)
print(divine)
{% endprogram %}

In the previous program, we've written <code>result += i</code> instead of <code>result = result + i</code>. The operators <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code> are common shortcuts; see the code section. <!-- the line <code>count += 1</code> is arguably the most widespread line in coding. -->


 
{% Step 12 of X %}
<h2>Step can be negative</h2>


<p>To iterate over a decreasing sequence, we can use an extended form of <code>range()</code> with three
arguments &mdash; <code>range(start_value, end_value, step)</code>. When omitted, the step is implicitly
equal to 1. However, it can be any non-zero value. The loop always includes <code>start_value</code> and excludes <code>end_value</code>
during iteration:
{% program %}
for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(i)
# 10
# 8
# 6
# 4
# 2
{% endprogram %}

{% instructions %}
Click "Run" to see what happens in output!
{% endinstructions %}
 


{% Step 13 of X %}
<h2>Setting the function print()</h2>

By default, the <code>print()</code> function prints all its arguments separating them by a space and then puts
the newline symbol after it. This behavior can be changed using keyword arguments <code>sep</code> (separator) and <code>end</code>.

{% program %}
print(1, 2, 3)
print(4, 5, 6)
print(1, 2, 3, sep=', ', end='. ')
print(4, 5, 6, sep=', ', end='. ')
print()
print(1, 2, 3, sep='', end=' -- ')
print(4, 5, 6, sep=' * ', end='.')
{% outputdata %}

{% endoutputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

{% instructions %}
Run this program and look what does it output.

With the first two lines everything is clear &mdash; it outputs "1 2 3" and "4 5 6" for obvious reasons. On the third line, it prints "1, 2, 3. 4, 5, 6." On the fourth line, it prints
