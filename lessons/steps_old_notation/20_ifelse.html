{% Step 1 of X %}
<h2>Syntax</h2>

Let's write a program which, given an integer x, prints |x| &mdash; its absolute value.

By definition of absolute value, if x > 0, such program should just print x. Otherwise, it should print -x. Naturally we are about to <em>check</em> if some condition is met. The behaviour is different when it <i>is</i> met and when it is not.

The keywords <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> are used in such situations. Look at the code:

{% program %}
x = int(input())
if x > 0:
    print(x)
else:
    print(-x)
{% inputdata %}
-273
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

Given -273 as the input data, it outputs 273. Why? Check the tick "step by step" and look at the visualizer. 

{% Step 2 of X %}
<h2>Carthage must be indented</h2>

Let's discuss what's happening in details.

This program uses a conditional statement <code>if</code>. After the <code>if</code>
we put a condition <code>(x&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0)</code> following by a colon.
After that we put a block of instructions which will be executed only if the condition
is true (i.e. evaluates to <code>True</code>). This block may be followed by the word
<code>else</code>, colon and another block of instructions which will be executed only if the condition is false
(i.e. evaluates to <code>False</code>). In the case above, the condition if false, so the if-block is ignored and the else-block
is executed. 

{% program %}
x = int(input())
if x > 0:
    print(x)
else:
    print(-x)
{% inputdata %}
-273
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

{% Step 3 of X %}
<h2>Carthage must be indented</h2>

<b>Each block (each set of instructions after colon) should be indented with four spaces or &lt;Tab&gt;.</b>

Look how each block after a colon is indented:


{% program %}
x = int(input())
if x > 0:
    print(x)
else:
    print(-x)

print("first line")
 print("second line")  # This will throw an error
# because of unexpected indentation

{% inputdata %}
-273
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

<b>Python won't understand you if you don't indent your code.</b>

<b>Remember Python also won't understand you if you indent your code in places where it's not expected.</b> So, code like 
<code>
print("first line")
 print("second line")
</code>
would throw the error.


{% Step 4 of X %}
<h2>Carthage must be indented</h2>

Erase the indentation and receive the error:


{% program %}
x = int(input())
if x > 0:
    print(x)
else:
    print(-x)
{% inputdata %}
-273
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}


{% Step 5 of X %}
<h2>Carthage must be indented</h2>



<p>To sum up, the conditional statement in Python has the following syntax:
<pre>
if <var>condition</var>:
    <span style="color: green;">true-block</span>
    <span style="color: green;">several instructions that are executed</span>
    <span style="color: green;">if the condition evaluates to True</span>
else:
    <span style="color: red;">false-block</span>
    <span style="color: red;">several instructions that are executed</span>
    <span style="color: red;">if the condition evaluates to False</span>
</pre>


{% Step 6 of X %}
<h2>Yet another absolute value</h2>


You can omit the <code>else</code> keyword and the whole false-block if nothing should be
done if the condition is false. For example, we can replace the variable <code>x</code>
with its absolute value like this:
{% program %}
x = int(input())
if x < 0:
    x = -x
print(x)
{% inputdata %}
-273
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

Indeed, the variable <code>x</code> is assigned to <code>-x</code> only if <code>x &lt; 0</code>.
In contrast, the instruction <code>print(x)</code> is executed every time, because it's not indented,
so it doesn't belong to the true-block.

<p>Indentation is a general way in Python to separate blocks of code. All instructions within the same
block should be indented the same way, i.e. they should have the same number of spaces
at the beginning of the line. It is recommended to use 4 spaces for indentation.

<p>In most of other languages the curly braces <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> are used to form blocks. This is the question of habit, but, to our opinion, indentation makes your code far more readable than keeping an eye on all the curly braces. 

{% Step 7 of X %}
<h2>Nested conditions</h2>

Any Python instruction may be put into if-block and else-block, including another conditional
statement. This way we get nested conditions. The blocks of inner conditions are indented
using twice more spaces (eg. 8 spaces). Let's see an example. Given the coordinates of the point
on the plane, print its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrant_(plane_geometry)">quadrant</a>.
{% program %}
x = int(input())
y = int(input())
if x > 0:
    if y > 0:
        # x > 0, y > 0
        print("Quadrant I")
    else:    
        # x > 0, y < 0
        print("Quadrant IV")
else:
    if y > 0:
        # x < 0, y > 0
        print("Quadrant II")
    else:    
        # x < 0, y < 0
        print("Quadrant III")
{% inputdata %}
2
-3
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}


See we've given the input "2", "-3". So, x = 2, y = -3. x > 0, so the block after <code>x > 0</code> will be executed. The condition <code>y > 0</code> is false, so the block following after it won't be executed. Since the condition <code>y > 0</code> is false, <code>else</code> block will be executed. It will print "Quadrant IV".

{% Step 8 of X %}
<h2>Comparison operators</h2>

<p>Usually the condition after <code>if</code> has one or more of the following operators:

 <dl>
<dt><code>&lt;</code><dd>less&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->&mdash; the condition is true if left side is less than right side. 

<br><dt><code>&gt;</code><dd>greater&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->&mdash; the condition is true if left side is greater than right side. 
<br><dt><code>&lt;=</code><dd>less or equal.
<br><dt><code>&gt;=</code><dd>greater or equal.
<br><dt><code>==</code><dd>equal.
<br><dt><code>!=</code><dd>not equal.
</dl>

<p>For example, the condition <code>x&nbsp;*&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1000</code>
means &ldquo;the value of the expression <code>x&nbsp;*&nbsp;x</code> is less than 1000&rdquo;,
and the condition <code>2&nbsp;*&nbsp;x&nbsp;!=&nbsp;y</code> means &ldquo;the doubled value
of the variable <code>x</code> is not equal to the value of the variable <code>y</code>&rdquo;.

<p>The comparison operators in Python may be chained like this: <nobr><code>a == b == c</code></nobr> or <nobr><code>x &lt;= y &gt;= 10</code></nobr>. It's a rare thing among programming languages.



{% Step 9 of X %}
<h2>True and false</h2>


{% program %}
print(2 < 5)    # will print "True"
print(2 > 5)    # will print "False"
print(7 <= -1)  # will print "False"
print(6 >= 6)   # will print "True"
print(5 == 8)   # will print "False"
print(8 != 4)   # will print "True"
print(73 != 73) # will print "False"
print(2 == 2)   # will print "True"
{% endprogram %}

<p>When you do a proposition, it can be true and false. Look at the code section. 

<p>You probably agree that "2 < 5" is true and "2 > 5" is false. You probably also agree that it's false that 7 <= -1 and it's true that 6 >= 6.

But what on <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>? What are that operators?

The operator <code>==</code> stands for "is equal to", and the operator <code>!=</code> means "is not equal to". As simple as that.

Now you can ensure that 8 != 4 and 2 == 2, and that propositions "5 == 8" and "73 != 73" are not true.


{% instructions %}
Run the code.
{% endinstructions %}


{% Step 10 of X %}
<h2>Boolean objects, boolean type</h2>


{% program %}
print(bool(-10))    # True
print(bool(0))      # False - zero is the only false number
print(bool(10))     # True

print(bool(''))     # False - empty string is the only false string
print(bool('abc'))  # True
{% endprogram %}

As our clever Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean">tells us</a>, a Boolean data type is a data type with only two possible values: true or false.

So if variable <code>a</code> is boolean, it can have only two values, and those values are <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>. 

There's the peculiarity. Actually you can assign numbers to such variable: <code>a = 0</code> or <code>a = 1</code>. This is because Python treats <code>0</code>as <code>False</code> and treats <code>1</code> as <code>True</code>. 


The <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> objects have a special type called <code>bool</code>.
As <code>int()</code> tries to convert input data to integer, you can use <code>bool()</code> to cast input data to true or false. Look at the code section.



{% Step 11 of X %}
<h2>The magic of logic</h2>

Sometimes you need to check several conditions at once.
For example, you can check if a number <code>n</code> is even using the condition
<code>n&nbsp;%&nbsp;2&nbsp;==&nbsp;0</code>
(<code>n</code> gives a remainder <code>0</code> when dividing by <code>2</code>).
If you need to check that two numbers <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> are both even, 
you should check both <code>n&nbsp;%&nbsp;2&nbsp;==&nbsp;0</code>
and <code>m&nbsp;%&nbsp;2&nbsp;==&nbsp;0</code>.
To do that, you join them using an operator <code>and</code>
(logical AND): <code>n&nbsp;%&nbsp;2&nbsp;==&nbsp;0&nbsp;and&nbsp;m&nbsp;%&nbsp;2&nbsp;==&nbsp;0</code>.


{% program %}
n = int(input())
m = int(input())

if n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
    print("Hooray!")
else:
    print("X-ray")
{% inputdata %}
58
12
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}



{% Step 12 of X %}
<h2>AND, OR and negation</h2>

<p>
Python has logical AND, logical OR and negation.

<p>Operator <code>and</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation">binary</a> operator which evaluates to <code>True</code>
if and only if both its left-hand side and right-hand side are <code>True</code>.

<p>Operator <code>or</code> is a binary operator which evaluates to <code>True</code>
if at least one of its sides is <code>True</code>.

<p>Operator <code>not</code> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation">unary</a> negation.
It's evaluated to <code>True</code> if the input value is <code>False</code>, and, vice versa, it's evaluated to <code>false</code> if the input value is <code>true</code>.

<p>Let's check that at least one of the two numbers ends with 0:

{% program %}
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
if a % 10 == 0 or b % 10 == 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
{% inputdata %}
15
40
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

{% Step 13 of X %}
<h2>AND, OR and negation</h2>


<p>Operator <code>and</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation">binary</a> operator which evaluates to <code>True</code>
if and only if both its left-hand side and right-hand side are <code>True</code>.

<p>Operator <code>or</code> is a binary operator which evaluates to <code>True</code>
if at least one of its sides is <code>True</code>.

<p>Operator <code>not</code> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation">unary</a> negation.
It's evaluated to <code>True</code> if the input value is <code>False</code>, and, vice versa, it's evaluated to <code>false</code> if the input value is <code>true</code>.

<p>Let's check that the number <code>a</code> is positive and 
the number <code>b</code> is non-negative:

<pre>if a &gt; 0 and not (b &lt; 0):
</pre>

<p>Instead of <code> not (b&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0)</code> we can write <code>(b&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0)</code>.

{% Step 14 of X %}
<h2>Elif</h2>

If you have more than two options using the conditional operator, you can use 
<code>if... elif... else</code> statement.

Look at the code section to see how it works: 

{% program %}
x = int(input())
y = int(input())
if x > 0 and y > 0:
    print("Quadrant I")
elif x > 0 and y < 0:
    print("Quadrant IV")
elif y > 0:
    print("Quadrant II")
else:
    print("Quadrant III")
{% inputdata %}
-5
7
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

As you can see, we've just rewritten the example with point (x,y) and quadrants from above.

<p>In this case the conditions in <code>if</code> and <code>elif</code>s are checked one after another until
the first true condition is found. Then only the true-block for that condition is being executed. If all the 
conditions are false, the else-block is being executed, if you've written it. :)
